- Activate the style of Element-Plus. Now it's theme is correct.
- Improved the initial layout by fully activating element-plus. In previous version, these styles are not effective because I didnot introduce the style css of Element really into our own project.
- Introduce a new project template "element-plus-vite-starter". It integrates vue3, vite and element-plus.

TODO for future:
- The current project (worldviewer) is generated by vite and set the language to "javascript" rather than "type script". Since more and more components are using TypeScript for developing, maybe we should also change to typescript too. But I'm not quite sure about the project settings. (It seems the current project can do with TS modules already.)
