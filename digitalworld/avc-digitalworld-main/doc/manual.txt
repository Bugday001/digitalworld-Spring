============================================
You can open this project with IntelliJ directly.

After start the application, visit the following URL in the browser:

	http://localhost:8080/greeting

And you'll see the following output in the browser(which is returned by the java application):

	{"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}

This is a JSON format string and you can capture it with JavaScript and convert the string to a JavaScript object and then access its properties and values more easily.
